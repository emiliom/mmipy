IPython notebooks 
=================

[IPython notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) illustrating specific MMI ORR functionality and access mechanisms.

Initially I'm populating this folder with my existing notebooks, from my gist and other sources. [My relevants gists are easily found via the _mmi_ tag](https://www.mygists.info/emiliom/tags/mmi) I've used (hopefully on all relevant gists). I also have one or two notebooks on my Wakari account, though they may be duplicates of my gists:

Collecting Python tools and examples for interacting with web services from the [Marine Metadata Interoperability (MMI)](https://marinemetadata.org) project's Ontology Registry and Repository ([MMI ORR](http://mmisw.org/)).

Initially everything will probably be in IPython notebooks only, so [look in the ipynotebooks directory](https://github.com/emiliom/mmipy/tree/master/ipynotebooks).

Much of the original ideas and samples owes a lot to [Sara Haines'](https://github.com/neaptide) examples. [Her nccoos/ioos-vocabulary-search github repo is probably a good starting point for her resources](https://github.com/nccoos/ioos-vocabulary-search). Her [nccoos/ioos-vocabulary-viz repo](https://github.com/nccoos/ioos-vocabulary-viz) is smaller, but also relevant.
